Groupie is a project done by me and group three students for the Denver Coding Boot Camp group assignment. This amazing app gives important information for the music fans.

How the app works.
1, while you are on the main page go a head and type the artist or band you want to see. while you are looking for the artist enjoy our dad joking(seriously they are funny).
after a few seconds, the app will display where your favorite artist is playing. the flight to the place where the artist is performing, the nearest restaurant where the place you want to go and the nearest hotels where the artist is playing the concert.
